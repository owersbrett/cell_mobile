Not only are they used to build the genetic database of organisms, they also play a role in energy storage and enzymatic activity. The 5 nucleotides are adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil.",

    longDescription: "RNA stands for ribonucleic acid. As the name suggests, RNA is an acid. There are many kinds of RNA, but the most well studied are messenger RNA (mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). The cell needs a way to transfer information. That information may involve the blueprints for modifying / creating ribosomes, orders from one part of the cell to another, as well as a variety of other things. It's important to note that RNA is single stranded.",

DNA is double-stranded, and base pairs form a hydrogen bond (hydrogen is 1 on the periodic table) keeping the DNA together as a unit. During certain intracellular processes, DNA oftentimes comes undone so that instructions can be decoded. It's important to note that in DNA is absent of uracil, and RNA is absent of thymine. Uracil and adenine pair in a similar way, but it is more of an attraction during intracellular processes, as opposed to the base pair composition found in DNA where bonds maintain the double helix.",

Mutations in DNA may or may not effect the individual to the point of drastic change, and may appear to be latent. Certain changes will be pronounced in the organism, changing how the organism behaves and appears in the world. Enough changes and a process known as speciation occurs. Evolution simply describes the reality that \n 1. Given extended periods of time...  \n 2. Mutations will create variety, some of which will prove to be selectively advantageous... \n 3. Causing these traits to become more pronounced in future offspring. \n These changes are stored in DNA, the genetic database, which tells individuals cells what to make and how to make it. This process is biological evolution, though it appears that evolution is not limited to only life.",

A membrane is used to describe a structure intended to separate structures / plasms / fluids. The nuclear membrane, separating the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, also provides passageways for particular materials, such as nucleic acids and proteins. These passageways may consist of proteins lodged within the double lipid bilayer. Lipids are a class of fatty acids and their derivates. In the context of the lipid bilayer, the cell is taking advantage of the fact that the tails are afraid of water (hydrophobic) and heads are attracted to water (hydrophillic). It's important to note that the nuclear membrane is a double lipid bilayer, both an inner and an outer, which separate the nucleoplasm from the cytoplasm. This and it's inner components represent the nucleus.",

There are no ribosomes attached to it's walls, which makes it different from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It's composed of a network of tubes, therefore it is tubular. It's important to note that endoplasmic means within the plasm, endo being a scientific prefix for inner or containing, and plasmic referring to cytoplasm in this case. The word reticulum is simply used to describe a thin network or mesh like structure.",

DNA is responsible for creating these little fellows, which spend there times travelling around the cell, decoding messages for the greater unit as well as forming peptide bonds. Ephemeral means that they last for a short period of time, then poof, they're decomposed. Peptide is a word used to describe a chain of amino acids. Ribosomes will link up amino acids and peptides in order to make proteins for the cell. Some hang out on the endoplasmic reticulum, which then would be described as the rough endoplasmic reticulum.",

Cilia are tiny cylinders that help with moving tiny structures, and in the context of centrioles, they assist with cell division. Asters help maneuver chromosomes during cell division to ensure the process occurs properly. The spindles are used to separate the chromosomes during cell division.",

When ATP expends energy, it becomes ADP, or adenosine diphosphate. Essentially the splitting off of the phosphate group allows for electrons to be used in particular chemical reactions, behaving as a currency in a way. Mitochondria is unique in that it has it's own DNA. This DNA is inherited almost exclusively from the mother. Mitochondria is also not present in blood cells.",
